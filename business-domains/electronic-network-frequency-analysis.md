# Electronic Network Frequency Analysis

Electrical network frequency (ENF) analysis is an [audio forensics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio\_forensics) technique for validating [audio recordings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio\_recording) by comparing frequency changes in background [mains hum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains\_hum) in the recording with long-term high-precision historical records of [mains frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains\_frequency) changes from a database.
